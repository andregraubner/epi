## ðŸ§¬ About

Epi is a masked-language model for methylomes. It integrates information from both single-base resolution gene sequences and the associated DNA methylation data to generate embeddings that are useful for many downstream tasks.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ”¬ Single-base resolution thanks to [cutting-edge state-space-model architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21060)
- ðŸ§ª Unified representation of methylomes: Epi models whole DNA sequences including methylation status of individual bases.

## ðŸš€ Installation

```bash
coming soon...
